Hello World! I'm doing the Git Challenge!

I'm practicing adding changes to my file and commiting the new changes.
So far I know about git init, git status, git add, git commit and now I wanna learn about git diff.

Still trying to figure Git diff out...

OK! That's done. So to use git diff, I need to remember that in order to see the changes or the differences between file 
I must diff before commiting. The comand is git diff <filename>

Now I'm experimenting with the remote. IMPORTANT to git remote add origin <urlfromgithub>
And after putting username and password you can push yoour local into the remote.
For that I use git push origin master. So in this case we'll send our branch named 'master' to our 
remote on GitHub named 'origin'.
